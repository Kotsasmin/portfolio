## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Kotsasmin/portofolio.git
   cd portfolio
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure that you have Node.js installed, then install the project dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To run the portfolio website locally, start the development server with the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, typically at `http://localhost:3000`, where you can view the website and see live changes as you develop.

## Available Scripts

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server with live reloading.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the application for production.
- **`npm run preview`**: Previews the production build locally (after running `npm run build`).

## Build

To create a production-ready build of your portfolio website, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will output optimized files to the `dist` directory, ready to be hosted on any static site hosting service.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety and improved code quality
- **CSS**: Styling for a visually appealing design
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup language
