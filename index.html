<!--A complete rewrite of the project in Next.js has begun. I plan to make it 
server-side rendered as I intend to add a store where users can download some 
of my selected apps. However, this may take considerable time to reach production 
due to my university commitments. I anticipate having both the store and the items 
I plan to sell ready for production before this summer.
